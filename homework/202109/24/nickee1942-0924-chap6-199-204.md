# partitions 
Each piece of data (each record, row, or document) belongs to exactly one partition. 
Partition data is for the purpose of scalability. A large dataset can be distributed across many disks, and the query load can be distributed across many processors. 
## Partitioning and Replication 
If leader-follower replica is used, each node may be the leader for some partitions and a follower for other partitions. 
## Partitioning of Key-Value Data 
May have a unbalanced distribution
## Partitioning by Hash of Key 
To better deal with risk of skew and hot spots, many distributed datastores use a hash function to determine the partition for a given key. 
Different hashing function make have different hashing keys
Use consistent hashing to rebalance partitions
