### Dynamic partitioning 
Size is defined, and when a partition size is oversized, it splits into two partitions. Similarly,  when a partition becomes small again, a merge happens then.
It works for either key range partitioned data or hash partitioned data 
### Partitioning proportionally to nodes 
For each node, it has a fixed number of partitions
## Automatic vs Manual Rebalancing 
Some automatic rebalancings need the admin to approve.
Fully automatic could have some potential risks
## Request Routing 
Since node and partition relations are dynamic, it is hard to know which node to go when a request comes in( service discovery)
Some possible approaches
Client contract with node directly( randomly), send to routing tier and let the routing tier decides which node to go, client use notification to connect the right node
Keep problem is finding the right node with the requested data
