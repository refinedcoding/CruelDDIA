# Leaderless Replication 
## Writing to the Database When a Node Is Down 
Ignore the down node mark the data with version. When reads, it might get diff value but would use the newest version data 
## Read repair and anti-entropy 
### When reads, update the previous down nodes with the newest data
### An additional check happens in the background to fix the mismatched data version in different nodes
## Quorums for reading and writing 
n replicas, every write must be confirmed by w nodes to be considered successful and must query at least r nodes for each read. Must have r + w > n
## Limitations of Quorum Consistency 
Even r + w > n, there might be some edge cases get the stale value
Ex: two writes occur concurrently
### 	Monitoring staleness 
## Sloppy Quorums and Hinted Handoff
