# Transaction
Bundle multi reads and writes together in one logic chunk
## ACID concept
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability 
### ACID atomicity
define when a failure happens during a group of actions( reads and/or writes), it does one decision as taken the group as a transaction.
### Consistency 
Here it means invariant balance(or true). Ex. Bank account credits and debits should be balanced
### Isolation
Transactions with writes in the same part of the database should be isolated to avoid concurrency problems
### Durability 
## Single and Multi-Object Operations 
single-object operations prevent conflicts for concurrency problems such as multi writes happen at one part
A distributed database is difficult to handle multi-object transactions across different partitions
