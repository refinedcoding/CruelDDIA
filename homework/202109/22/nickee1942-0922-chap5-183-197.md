# Sloppy Quorums and Hinted Handoff 
## Multi-datacenter operation 
# Detecting Concurrent Writes 
several clients to concurrently write to the same key, conflict may happen since the latest data in different node might be different
## Last write wins (discarding concurrent writes) 
Use timestamp or UUID to distinguish different writes and made largest timestamp, for example, as the last write
## The “happens-before” relationship and concurrency 
How to decide two operations are concurrent
Not concurrent - An operation A happens before another operation B 
Concurrent - Either A happens before B or B happens before A
## Capturing the happens-before relationship 
The server maintains a version number for every key, increments the version number every time that key is written, and stores the new version number along with the value written. 
## Merging concurrently written values 
ensures no data is silently dropped, but requires clients do extra work such as 	clean up afterward by merging the concurrently written values  ## Version vectors 
For multi replicas, a version number per replica as well as per key is needed. Each replica increments its own version number
