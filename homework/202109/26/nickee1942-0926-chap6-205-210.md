## Skewed Workloads and Relieving Hot Spots 
most data systems are not able to automatically compensate for a highly skewed workload ## Partitioning and Secondary Indexes 
### two main approaches:
document-based partitioning and term-based partitioning. 
### Partitioning Secondary Indexes by Document 
each partition is separate: each partition maintains its own secondary indexes, covering only the documents in that partition. 
### Partitioning Secondary Indexes by Term 
it makes reads more efficient than by document. However, the global index is slower and more complicated 
## Rebalancing Partitions 
The process of moving load from one node in the cluster to another ## Strategies for Rebalancing 
### Not to do: hash mod N
### Fixed number of partitions 
Only entire partitions are moved between nodes. The number of partitions does not change, nor does the assignment of keys to partitions.
