# Handling Write Conflicts 
## Synchronous vs asynchronous conflict detection 
Sync loses the pros of multi leader
Async may has write conflict
## Conflict avoidance 
It is hard to avoid at all if one of the multi leaders is down and need to read from other leaders. Data may vary as async/ user writes into the specific local leader
## Converging toward a consistent state 
Serval ways to decide which data is the final version to writes into the leader and replicas, such as use unique ids and sort the ids then pick up the highest one
## Custom conflict resolution logic 
Let the client/user to decide which version should be use
# Multi-Leader Replication Topologies 
Circular topology
A write need to pass through serval node to reach all replicas
Cons: One node fails would cause problem and interrupt all other nodes
Star topology
All to all topology( The most general)
