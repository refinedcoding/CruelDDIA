# Chapter 1 Reliable, scalable and maintainable applications
## Maintainability
- operability: easy to operate
- simplicity: easy for new hires
- evolvability: easy to make changes to the system in the future.

### operability: making life easy for operations
- monitoring the health of the system
- tacking down ROA
- keep up to date, security patch
- anticipate future problem
- establishing good practices and tools
- perform complex maintenace tasks
- maintaining the security of system
- doc
- automation

### Simplicity: managing complexity
- good abstraction

### evolvability: making change easy
- Agile working pattern

## Summary
- functional and non functional requirement
  - realiability
  - scalability
  - maintainability

### CAP theory
- Consistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time. It is equivalent to having a single up-to-date copy of the data.
- Availability: Every request received by a non-failing node in the system must result in a response
- Partition tolerance: continues to operate despite partial system failure or arbitrary message loss
- any distributed system needs to pick two out of the three properties
