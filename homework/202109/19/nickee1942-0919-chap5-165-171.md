# Monotonic Reads â€¨Reads data and may see an old value. It means that if one user makes several reads in a queue, they will not see time go backward
# Consistent Prefix Reads 
# Replication Lag 
# Multi-Leader Replication 
Allow more than one node to accept writes 
## Use Cases 
### Multi-datacenter operation 
Each datacenter has a leader
#### Pros
Performance better
outages and network tolerance 
### Clients with offline operation 
Every device has a local database be a leader. An asynchronous multi-leader replication process happens between the replicas of database on all devices 
### Collaborative editing 
Lock on when changes(writes) happen on one side and this ensure no conflicts between multi sides
However, this model is equivalent to single-leader replication with transactions on the leader.
