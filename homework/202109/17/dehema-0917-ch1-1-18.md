# Chapter 1 Reliable, scalable and maintainable applications
## reliability
- performs the function that user expected
- tolerate user mistakes or using the software in unexpected ways
- performance is good for requried use case under expected load and data volume
- prevents any unauthorized access and abuse

### hardware faults
- add reduant for hard disk, power supplies and etc
- trendency to software fault tolerance tech

### software errors
- software bug
- consume shared resource- CPU, memory, disk space or network bandwidth
- performance issue, slow down, unresponsive, corrupted reponse
- cascading failures

### human errors
- design system that minimizes opportunities for error, eg well-defined APIs.
- decouple the system
- test thoroughly
- easy and fast to recover, like roll-back mechanism
- monitoring 
- management practices and training

## scalability
### describing load
- describe current system load, 
- like write/read QPS

### describing performance
- throughput: the number of records can process per second
- response time, median p50, p95, p99, p999, tail latency, SLO, SLA
- latency
- head of line blocking

### aproaches for coping with load
- scale up, vertical
- scale out, horizontal
- elastic system
